About
-----
This plugin adds tags to output the internal IP ban list maintained in
Movable Type. For example:
```
   <MTBannedList>
      <$MTBannedListValue$>
   </MTBannedList>
```
The purpose of this is to allow blog owners to share their blacklists. Attached,
you will find two template files, one to generate RSS 2.0 feed of the blacklist
and a second to generate a plain text file. To use, add this file to your
MovableType plugins directory and add either of the two templates.
