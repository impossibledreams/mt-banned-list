About
-----
This plugin adds tags to output the internal IP ban list maintained in Movable Type.
Originally created in Feburary of 2005. For example:
```
   <MTBannedList>
      <$MTBannedListValue$>
   </MTBannedList>
```
The purpose of this is to allow blog owners to share their blacklists. Attached,
you will find several template files, for generating an RSS feed, a text file
and a DxL feed. To use, add this plugin and one of the templates to your
MovableType plugins directory.

DxL format is described in the attached Internet draft:
